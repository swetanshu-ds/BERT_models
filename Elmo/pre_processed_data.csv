activation_function,In this video as Sudhansu sir explains that we are using the SoftMax function for the classification in the outer layer the formula for SoftMax is e^x(i)/Sum(e^x(i). How did we get the value for these classes? Because in the video when sir explained SoftMax activation function using the dice example it was pretty simple but can you please explain this
activation_function,"I have some doubts regarding Activation function, can you please help me?"
activation_function,Suppose i am using any activation function and accuracy of my model is not good. How can I make sure that my model not effected by vanishing gradient and exploding gradient problems
activation_function,"I know in case vanishing gradient weight of inner layer doesn&apos;t change, but how can i detect that Actually if i am using deep neural n/w and my model is not performing . And i am using &quot;sigmoid&quot; or &quot;tanh&quot; activation function then there is possibilty that due these  activation function &quot;vanishing gardient&quot; is effected my model, how can i check that how can we detect &quot;vanishing gardient&quot; in model? Because model performance might be effected by various factors."
activation_function,I am a student of DLCVNLP 25th batch and have a question related to a concept told in last class As taught by Sudhanshu sir in last class that non zero centric property is a disadvantage for activation functions
activation_function,yes i am asking like where should we write the article. For suppose if i need to write an article on activation function. How should we write?
activation_function,One more doubt . What is meant by self gated as swish is self gated Activation Function?
activation_function,"Do we have any one handy like for which problem what activation,loss,optimizer to be used"
activation_function,"that is fine. i am asking about the usage of activation, loss and optimizers in different use cases generally and recommended ones do we have any handy?"
activation_function,what is the official site to get the details of activation function loss function ?
activation_function,"hi there! why zero centric functions are better for gradient update? say if we are comparing sig and tanh functions, 
sig(x) will always be positive and d(sig(x))/dx wil be positive so gradient(derivative) always moves in positive direction"
activation_function,"here as well the <b raw_pre=""*"" raw_post=""*"">*derivative/gradient is always positive*</b>, then why did Sudhanshu say that gradient goes is -ve or +ve direction , so weights can be updated in both directions during backward propagation , and hence it is better than sigmoid<e_m a=""live:itstannus"" ts_ms=""1597405697212"" ts=""1597405697"" t=""61""></e_m>"
activation_function,"but if we consider tanh , tanh(x) may be -ve or +ve but <b raw_pre=""*"" raw_post=""*"">d(tanh(x))/dx will always be positive</b><e_m a=""live:itstannus"" ts_ms=""1597405621375"" ts=""1597405621"" t=""61""></e_m>"

batch_details,Hello I am a student in DLCVNLP Course of 10th October
Bert_query,Why we used Bert for Text classification?
Bert_query,"for text classfication why we used BERT ,,?"
Bert_query,i know all the algo for BERT what is input ?
Bert_query,for bert algo what is input ?
Bert_query,For adress ner model can bert used for that? Like from an address I need to extract street name postal code building flats etc. So for which deep learning model can be used?
Bert_query,Also. What prerequisites are there for understanding bert? Currently I am in the cnn part..
Bert_query,where we are mentioning which bert model to be used?
Bert_query,i tried to run the bert-large-cased model in paperspace
Bert_query,"i was able to train bert base cased on this, only large is failing"
Bert_query,do you have any resources on finetuning the bert model? any previous batch recording?? bert ner
Bert_query,is mobilebert even faster than the albert? but seems like mobilebert has only one pretrained model till now
Bert_query,It&apos;s same as the bert ner from dashboard
Bert_query,Hi I haven&apos;t seen how to implement bert in python
Bert_query,"Hi Team!
Can you suggest some resources for implementing BERT question and answering model?"
Bert_query,I need to build bert search engine model
Bert_query,Which deep learning model I can use after getting word embeddings from BERT?
Bert_query,while training bert example
Bert_query,I need to train the BERT and predict for arablic NER
Bert_query,I want to train bert multilingual mode
Bert_query,I was trying to train bert ner with custom samples
Bert_query,can i use 2 pre trained model in bert
Bert_query,bert multiligual cased and other is arabert
Bert_query,some of words in english is is not predicted which is happening properly in bert-multilingual-cased

Right now I am getting confused with what to focus my studies on, I am following iNeuron&apos;s course as well but due to only weekend classes, I feel the pace is a bit slow. I get time on week days as well to study, so how should I plan my studies and what should I study to fastrack and build a very strong foundational base?"

So as a Data scientist, do these devops skills boost our profle in interviews?"
career_transition,"unfortunately i have lost my job last thursday as i was laid off from Accenture. I would like to get some advise from your side, I have almost completed the MLD 6th June course and preparing myself for interview. So in this condition shall i also keep going on with the DL course , learning new things or fully concentrate on the ML part only and make myself more proficient in that. I have 5+ years exp. Tech Stack : Python Flask Gitlab CICD ML."
career_transition,"I wanted to get some advise from you as I have lost my job recently, laid off from Accenture"
career_transition,"i have an interview with Legato on Saturday fro ML NLP, any tips or guidance , any topics specific that i need to see? which are for sure questions will come from and very important."
career_transition,"I have got two offers in data science ...Xoriant and TensorIOT..and i received this within one month of layoff from my previous organization Accenture, but i am doubtful of the stability in TensorIOT can you please guide me ..which one i should go ahead with"
career_transition,"now Xoriant is a mid level company bt TensorIOT is a startup company and TensorIOT is more focussed on ML, DL computer vision and using AWS services and IOT using aws services so i am guessing there will be a huge learning curve<e_m a=""live:dc86097acf4e85b1"" ts_ms=""1600356139843"" ts=""1600356139"" t=""61""></e_m> I am going ahead with Xoriant for now but Tensor Iot was surely good. However not confident on taking another risk on a startup right now on grounds of stability after being laid off in August from Accenture"
career_transition,"Can anyone get job as fresher by implementing ML only in mumbai? because many people says that for that go for data analyst first, you will not get job here direct"
career_transition,"I am from ML 28th batch but that will take time to complete.so I want to apply for data analyst. For data analyst, Should I have work on live project for EDA or I can get without live project also?"
career_transition,"Please don&apos;t get me wrong when I ask u this , but I am doing the MLDL6 course started recently, and I want to make a career out of data science as a data scientist. Can u please tell me the other things or softwares or anything I should learn as well to improve myself during this free time ? Currently I am learning tableau and SQL along with ur stats community classes and live MLDL classes too."
career_transition,"NLP or Computer vision, WHich can be a best area of research?"
career_transition,Sir I need Some Carreer Guidance
career_transition,"So I was checking (gaming domain) 
Like you know games like 
Fifa and many other.
They also use artificial intelligence. 
So what should be skillset for the same.
And also as a fresher 
Do they let a fresher apply.?"
career_transition,A little bit of career related support I required.
career_transition,"Now here are some things .

1. He said that data science is for 
Masters or PhD graduates. 
Is it?"
career_transition,"Sir.
What will be your suggestion?"
career_transition,"And.
Just another thing.

Like 
I have discussed with sudhanshu sir.
As well.
And he told it wont be much of a problem.
I&apos;m doing bca now and I&apos;m in first year.

So will I have to wait for my graduation to complete to get the jobs or will I be able to get it before also.

Given I&apos;m doing correspondence degree"
career_transition,"I&apos;m gonna be 22 now.
That will be a huge gap.
Like before my graduation start there is a gap.
And then again for 2 years."
career_transition,"I read that.
Bca graduates are paid less In ds field and also.
They dont get good work to do.
Is it?"
career_transition,"I came across this channel pepcoding.
For 
Ds and algo. 
I had a chat with the person.

But he said as I&apos;m doing (bca from correspondence).
He said 
Ds jobs require masters or PhDs degree."
career_transition,"How should I keep moving forward? 
"
career_transition,"I have just a small query...
Yes I&apos;m seeing the classes. But as you know I&apos;m doing correspondence degree. So not so much involved in college class.
So I was asking 
What guidance you would give me?"
career_transition,"And 
What are the skills that are required for ds?
Is that all covered in the course?
Like SQL 
Deployment. 
Right?"
career_transition,"Hey I just had 1 question.
Please tell if it is true or not.

Since I&apos;m doing bca . It&apos;s a 3 year degree course.

I was reading that many companies hire people with 4 year degree(btech) for data science. 
Is it true?
Or 
Bca can also get ds jobs?"
career_transition,"Hello I just have a small question. 
As seeing 
Many ml algorithms are getting automated.
So I was reading.
In coming future 
There wont be a need for data scientists. 
Is it true?
"
career_transition,"Hello sir
Sudhanshu sir or jiwitesh sir online?
Actually I wanted a career related advice..."
career_transition,"It&apos;s just I am doing the course. 
But i just wanted a guidance..."
career_transition,"Hello sudhanshu sir 
Or 
Jiwitesh sir online?
Actually I wanted to discuss a brief about career. 
Just a guidance I required."
career_transition,"I wanted to discuss a brief about career.
Since dashboard mails takes a little time to revert."
career_transition,"Oh
I had some things to discuss 
Some guidance I needed."
career_transition,"For data science 
We should also know.
R and scala?
Or python would work?
And yeh I&apos;m also getting my hands on java 
Know 
Some c++ and c 
So will it work?"
career_transition,"Of course I&apos;m learning. 
But as I have correspondence learning. 
So I want to start with internship and fresher jobs 
I understand that will be after I complete and have knowledge. 
But what is the correct path to that knowledge?"
career_transition,"5. Most important 
Will I be able to get 
Data science 
Data analysis jobs 
With correspondence degree?
Or to start with 
With no degree?"
career_transition,"But there is a possibility. 
To get into data science field with 
Correspondence degree.
Or to start with no degree?"
career_transition,"But what will I do for 2 years?
As the course will be completed in some months."
career_transition,"2. And the course itself motivates us to do more 
And after the course and projects 
We will have a great github profile and CV built.
It will be beneficial for sure.
And many will be able to see the projects and skills we have.

So it will give chances for the recruiters to hire us? 
"
career_transition,"Hello I was reading.
That in the coming years like 
3 to 4 years 
Maybe 
Golang 
Ruby
Rust 
Will take over python for data science.

I know that maybe true or not 
But if I know 
Python 
And java and c++ 

Will I be able to learn any new language? 
"
career_transition,"Yes 
But as a data scientist 
Is it recommended? 
Because I was reading 
There will be ui team too."
career_transition,Sir i want to discuss career related questions with you.
career_transition,I have done some projects in data science. I just wanted to solve as many datasets as much as I can. But the thing is I cant understand where exactly I&apos;m in my journey... can u check me with an basic test.. so you can push me to do projects parallel to this course
career_transition,I don&apos;t know how close I&apos;m to get a job... I know all basic things
career_transition,can you just check out my GitHub and knowledge so as to judge me as in where I&apos;m. I feel lost in ml world...
career_transition,a 1 to 1 session would have been great so as to give me clear picture on how to utilise this course 100% w.r.t my requirement... also it will be easy on your side too...
career_transition,sir i have completed my mba with marketing and operation specialisation. sir for which domain should i target after completing this course.
career_transition,is it possible to switch over my job to data science?
career_transition,"Hi Sir, I need some career guidance. So will you please help me out regarding this."
career_transition,"Good morning 
I want guidance related to my carrier can any help me ..."
career_transition,"Hi,

cnn_question,"Hi, in CNN I am not able to understand how the backpropagation happens in filters. What I mean is after doing Convolution by applying filters, padding, pooling then we flatten the arrays, right? So, after flattening we can see this as a normal neural network and find the weights using back propagation. I understood until here, so how does the filters used for convolution get updated or changed? or Do they even change?"
cnn_question,"Hi, in CNN Sudhanshu told that if we give batch_size as 32 then the model takes 32 pixels at a time. What does it mean? Isn&apos;t the entire image taken at a time as a input to the model?"

cnn_question,We have not been provided with the recorded videos of CNN class
cnn_question,I am facing an issue with CNN multiclass classifier
cnn_question,Sir I have a doubt regarding CNN
cnn_question,Hello Team do we know the no of classes to be classified in a CNN?
cnn_question,In Conv1 we are saying the input will be a black and white image on which 6 kernels will be applied each of size 3 In conv2 we are saying the input will be 6 and 16 kernels will be applied each of size three which is also self explanatory but then in fc1 how is the input 16*6*6 the dimension of the features will depend on the dimension of the input image For example in CNN using Keras we had defined the dimensions of the input image but this 16*6*6 is not intuitive
cnn_question,"Hello team, This is the documentation of Flatten() function. As conveyed by Sudhanshu sir in the class that it operates as a convolution layer by applying the filter size equal to the size of the input image so that the output is 1*1 dimension however from the above documentation that is not the case"
cnn_question,CNN basics
cnn_question,actually i have formatted my laptop and installing it again to practice the advance CNN problem statements
cnn_question,"if any other alternate option is their , so that i can do the CNN project work over there then plz let me know"
cnn_question,"Sir in cnn, we used target size as (64,64). If our image size is bigger and if we using target size as (64,64) means we are losing our data, is it correct?
"
cnn_question,"And sir, in cnn the back propagation happen twice. One for updating the filter values, and another for reducing the error in feed forward connection like normal ANN. Is this correct?"
cnn_question,"Sir, I trained the cnn model with cat, dog, and my images for 5 epoch and 800 steps per epoch. It&apos;s giving almost 50% correct results. It&apos;s accuracy after the 5th epoch is 1 and loss is 9.104e-6. Is it an overfitted model?"
cnn_question,i wanna try CNN on family images .. how many atleast are needed for training ? Its hard to get 200 or 500 images of each individual .. or can I train on some other model and use it for clustering my images?
cnn_question,testing dog cat prediction code for CNN with keras

cnn_question,"Sir, in layman term how can we explain what is kernel in cnn"
cnn_question,"Hi Sir, in CNN, if image size is (64,64,3) and kernal size is (32,(3,3)) then output matrix will be (n-f+1) =( 64 - 32 + 1) = (33 , 33,3) right?"
cnn_question,"and how can we form maxpooling as (2,2),? can you please give me the calculation part for the maxpooling for (2,2),"
cnn_question,will we reduce the matrix till 2x2 in maxpooling?
cnn_question,"what is the role of pool_size =(2,2) in MaxPooling()?"

cnn_question,How to train images to do image classification when all images of different classes are in single folder?
cnn_question,we were asked to do an assignment by taking images of friend and family and train different CNN architectures over it
cnn_question,"In the yesterday&apos;s class, Mr. Sudhanshu has shared one CNN model (dog/cat) classification. 
My question is, this problem can be solved with the help of svm model as well, then why we are using CNN model?
Does CNN model helps in extracting features without explicitly explained? Is this the only reason?

cnn_question,regarding multiclass classifier using CNN
cnn_question,they only have given only one image each . and I am thinking of using I am thinking of using image argumentation on cropped nut image. and use yolo or rcnn . please provide me some inputs
cnn_question,sir I am not able to visualize the working of calculating loss in CNN
cnn_question,"ok so suppose i have a 3d image of 10*10*10 and i am using 1 filter of 3*3. so the output will be 8*8*8*1*3. am i correct??<e_m a=""live:deepakagarwal827"" ts_ms=""1601193716352"" ts=""1601193716"" t=""61""></e_m>"

cnn_question,sir i am not able to understand how calculation works here between 6 feature map of 14*14 with 16 filters of 5*5
cnn_question,"yes sir but sometimes people use 224*224, sometimes 64*64, and sometimes 128*128 and others. but how did they decide to choose this size?"

cnn_question,"Sir wanted to check if CNN model is saved after fit step or model evaluate step? Moreover, does the model.h5 saves weights or model architecture or both?No it&apos;s a general question as in our dogcat classification, we saved the model after fit_transform step. But on internet I saw some articles saving the weight and architecture separately.
Hence wanted to check if model.h5 saves weights and/or architecture and if this saving is done after fit step or evaluate step Sorry our model used fit_generator. Moreover, wanted to check if we could have used .fit method for our dogcat classification instead of fit_generator"

dashboard_how_to_use,I&apos;m aware that Sudh tried to restart it in this month but I could only find one video
dashboard_how_to_use,"hi, I have joined the DLCVNLP batch very lately i.e 25th May. After looking at the dashboard i was little confused about which sequence to follow."
dashboard_how_to_use,hi i have enrolled 22 th march but due to some reason didn&apos;t continue but when u started new batch i get access 28th march dashboard.now i want to know where i am able to complete assiggnment. i think in 28 th march valid for me please suggest
dashboard_how_to_use,"and i see in 22 th march dashboard there is mentioned python subjective test ,and objective test with 150 point.i didn&apos;t find in 28 th march"
dax_query,"Plz correct me if I am wrong, Basically DAX functions are used to create virtual columns based on mathematical calculations"
dax_query,Can we apply DAX functions only to create New measures or we can apply DAX functions to any of the existing columns in the data set?
dax_query,When will be the important DAX formulas collections uploaded in the dashboard?
dax_query,I am having problem with dax performing SUMX in poweBI.  measure shows the the total values in every column.
dax_query,how can i create outer order
dax_query,i have a doubt about dax syntax
decision_tree_ML,from where we will get this &quot;information gain&quot; and &quot;Entropy&quot;
decision_tree_ML,"Sir, explained the calculation of Entropy and Information gain. However, I have a query. The class was explained with categorrical input variable, viz., X, Y,Z 3 columns containing categorical values either 0 or 1,. 
Hence, it was good to calculate Entropy and info gain."
decision_tree_ML,I am working on decision trees assignment which is titanic dataset
decision_tree_ML,it&apos;s decision trees assignment
decision_tree_ML,so what would you suggest me to learn D.T regressor and how does it work with continuous variable?
decision_tree_ML,sir i am asking can you please share me the source from where i can learn D.T regressor and working with continuous variables as its video not mentioned in curriculum but it was discussed in previous batch.
decision_tree_ML,"I had a doubt ..i watched the videos on decision trees. If we split the numerical feature based on Gini index or entropy ,wont the computational time be higher? Is there a best method to prune numerical feature in decision tree?"
decision_tree_ML,"And sir one more doubt, in decision tree, what happens if entropy of more than one columns are same ? Which one is chosen as the parent node ?"
decision_tree_ML,Gini Index is considered when we do have continues data in a column and Entropy will be considered when we have categorical column for Random Forest.
decision_tree_ML,In decision tree do we calculate entropy only once or at every node when calculating information gain?
decision_tree_ML,Do we calculate Gini only once?
decision_tree_ML,"I came across many different formulas for calculating entropy and Information Gain. Can you please clear the doubt, how it is calculated?"
decision_tree_ML,"I have a question in decision Tree, what if entropy of two features are same?"
decision_tree_ML,as in Information Gain
decision_tree_ML,"1) what is the relationship btw gini index and gini impurity?
2) What if the information gain of two features are the same and that is the highest information gain in the data set
3) What if features have both numerical and categorical features as independent features
4) I have sent an image on a question of logistic regression, help me understand the same"
decision_tree_ML,"do you mean two root nodes, can that really be possible?"
decision_tree_ML,Gini index and gini impurity are different
decision_tree_ML,In many places I see for Entropy and Gini Impurity are same except for the formula.
decision_tree_ML,Please let me know what is the formula of Information Gain
decision_tree_ML,This is entropy
decision_tree_ML,Information Gain
decision_tree_ML,Request you to please explain me Gini Impurity with Information gain
decision_tree_ML,can both Gini and Information Gain impurity be used for multi class classification?
decision_tree_ML,In that case why should we go for entropy.. i mean gini does the same job much more perfectly right
decision_tree_ML,"These are my understanding of splitting in decision tree.
Algorithms like ID3 uses only entropy and can be used only for classification, where as c4.5 is an advanced version of ID3. And even that uses entropy and information gain. And it can be used for both regression and classification. Wheres CART uses only gini and can be used for both regression and classification"
decision_tree_ML,will decision tree have negligible effect on outliers?
decision_tree_ML,at some blogs i read overfitting in DT is sometime due to outliers because it splits outliers in different node
decision_tree_ML,Does normalisation help reduce overfitting in decision trees ?
decision_tree_ML,Also i need to know how will decision tree split for numerical features.. i understand classification it&apos;ll take for every possible unique classification values..
decision_tree_ML,regarding numerical features in decision tree
decision_tree_ML,Correct me if am getting it right - For decision trees if the dependent feature is categorical then irrespective of if the independent features are either categorical or numerical we use gini index or entropy for splitting
decision_tree_ML,"I have one more query, does correlation affect decision tress, how about random forest?"
decision_tree_ML,Regarding decision tree
decision_tree_ML,"Hi Team, I had a doubt, for a classification problem if we define a set of rules , then what is the need for Decision Tree classifier? Why do we need to use this machine learning algorithm if we could manually write a set of rules for classifying, I was asked this question in an interview, what would be the correct answer for it? need your inputs"
decision_tree_ML,"Not manually , but write a python function and define a set of rules, in such case what will be the need of decision tree? this was the question I was asked"
decision_tree_ML,In decision tree algo how many trees we have to create for a dataset
decision_tree_ML,i had a doubt for decision tree
decision_tree_ML,"the decision tree and the branches inside the model is made based on the training dataset, what is if the test data has a data point for which the branch does not exist in that decision tree model? the leaf node wont be reached , then what happens?"
decision_tree_ML,"1. for decision tree when should we use gini and when should we go for entropy criterion -&gt; is GridSearch the only approach or we can judge by the dataset?
2. Out of bag evaluation - how do we get to know via code, when we use BaggingClassifier, that which features are &quot;out of bag&quot; , so that we can evaluate our model with those features <e_m a=""live:itstannus"" ts_ms=""1596127606435"" ts=""1596127606"" t=""61""></e_m>"
decision_tree_ML,"if min_sample_split is not met it will be converted to leaf node , but what would be final predicted class there if it is made leaf node"

EDA_code,I have a doubt on the bikes eda notebook
EDA_code,Hi..sir. In the ML dashboard for EDA and projects only code is given
EDA_code,"Am checking the EDA part, CristinoRonaldo"
EDA_code,when doing EDA how do we perform it
EDA_code,"in black_Friday EDA, for age category why are we doing ordinal encoding. I men we cannot tell with any order that this age group has higher purchase right, we should have used one hot only right?"
EDA_code,"and in bikes EDA, they profiling is not working, we had screen share for both"
EDA_code,also i want to ask ONe section EDA is given in our dashboard of MLD28 so its just for practise or we will get taught
EDA_code,I m having problem running an EDA pynb file
EDA_code,jus an EDA set
EDA_code,"Hi Team, sorry to bother you on a sunday evening, had a doubt. So while performing EDA we seperate categorical columns and numerical columns , and then performing encoding on categorical columns, perform standardization on numerical columns and then concatenate them together right? So I wanted to ask, if we have to perform PCA, then should we do it only on numerical columns or the columns we get after concatinating??"
EDA_code,in python community session EDA is not going to cover ?
EDA_code,i have one another question regarding EDA topics As you have mentioned syllabus about EDA in python community course so are you going to cover this topics ?
EDA_code,EDA material that you have uploaded on dashboard
EDA_code,where as in the &quot;bikes&quot; EDA every code in running succesfully

Exploratory data analysis?"
EDA_code,is we have to submit EDA for different data sets?
EDA_code,Can you just tell me the steps performed in EDA?
EDA_code,Do You have any video on EDA bikes or any other data set?
EDA_code,sir tried to perform eda using pandas profiling. I installed this library in my anaconda environment also in jupiter notebook but when trying to run this in notebook then it is showing that this module does not exist
EDA_code,I want to ask that will you cover eda portion because they started teaching regression and leaved the eda part
exception_handling,can you explain the question - Write a function to compute 5/0 and use try/except to catch the exceptions.
exception_handling,"i have done the class upto exception handling. According to my knowledge, i am not able to solve this"
exception_handling,"Before doing log transformation , let&apos;s add 1 to each valuue in the column to handle exception when we try to find log of &apos;0&apos;."
exception_handling,"So I was doing 
Exception handling again."
exception_handling,Do we use try except kind of blocks?
exception_handling,"And yeh a suggestion.
There are many projects. 
If the above is true.
Can you do 1 project using .
Try and except?"
exception_handling,"I was seeing 
We use try and except in many situations and it is so important."
exception_handling,"In our projects.
Will we use try except blocks?"
exception_handling,"We use exception handling 
Try except and finally block in our codes.
Yes.

All the projects or models we build.
On the industry level.
Do we use 
Exception handling in that?"
exception_handling,"I had a clarification on exception handling. when we use try and except in our code, the except is supposed to handle all the errors including system errors and os errors right?"
exception_handling,isnt it runtime error handler?
exception_handling,"oh ok, i ran to a problem where the exception block has not handled the exception and ended the program abruptly. i had ran the code in aws ec2, the server seems to have restarted in between and my code ended abruptly. how to handle this exception?"
exception_handling,In try except: Suppose I&apos;m handling database connection in try block to check if my database is successful and if not then return exception
exception_handling,Then whats the point handling the exception
exception_handling,I have some doubts in exception handling
exception_handling,After I mention the exception
exception_handling,Ya sir.But I give exception for NameError also
exception_handling,"In exception handling(try and except), incase of any errors program goes to except block and proceed further with the other commands. How can i stop my execution or script incase of exception instead of proceeding further Should I use sys.exit(1) in except block to abort the script?"
exception_handling,it throws an exception &quot;something is worng&quot;
exception_handling,I&apos;m getting some exception error please explain me
exception_handling,I did not understand how to solve this also Write a function to compute 5/0 and use try/except to catch the exceptions.
exception_handling,"Hi, I have a query regarding exception handling"
exception_handling,"basically below is the code, and its working , but im trying to handle two types of exception , how to do that"
exception_handling,"I have tried below one also, but I am not geeting your point, I can include two except block for a single try block?"

tfod_error,"Need some suggestions.. I am in canada,, I came here as java developer on-site but after that project they deployed me in DL project(I have zero knowledgein DL).. and they given 1 month of time for learning. It&apos;s been 4 months, I gained some knowldge with keras. But deploying an object detection application(which should not need internet to work), with keras became as hectic work to do and I have lot of pressure. So I used TFOD API, deployed it on android app using TFLite<e_m a=""live:sumannelli11"" ts_ms=""1587827999607"" ts=""1587827999"" t=""61""></e_m>"

tfod_error,Sir I used TFOD and developed an apk using TFLiteÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ But TFOD model layers are not customizable .. So As you suggested I will train SSD_keras_mobilenet model(Above you provided link) ..I will convert it tflite.. Do we have to made any customized apk framework for this or TFLite work?

for i in ll:
    if i==7:
        ll.remove(i)
    print(type(i))
    if type(i)==list:
        for j in i:
            if j==7:
              i.remove(j)
print(ll)
#output:[1, 2, 4, 5, 4, [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 7], [3, 4, 6, 9]]"
ticket_gen,can i know the reason y i am getting wrong output???
ticket_gen,OKay is there any property or anything fixed that which gives type as tuple??
ticket_gen,above code is not working
ticket_gen,"l=[1,2,7,4,5,7,4,7,[5,6,7,8,9,7],[3,4,6,7,9]]
i=0
while i&lt;len(l):
    if l[i]== 5:
        l.remove(5)
        i-=1
    if type(l[i]) == list:
        j=0
        while j&lt;len(l[i]):
            if l[i][j] == 5:
                l[i].remove(5)
                j-=1
            j=j+1
    i += 1
print(l) #output:[1, 2, 7, 4, 7, 4, 7, [6, 7, 8, 9, 7], [3, 4, 6, 7, 9]]"
ticket_gen,sry its my mistake

   objb=b()
   obja.test()
   objb.test()
objc=c()

ticket_gen,in the above example i am calling directly print stmt
ticket_gen,"class person:
    def own(self,name,surname):
        self.name=name
        self.surname=surname

I got this delivered within one day of being available in India and itâ€™s just great. I am a big fan of iOS and Iâ€™m deep into the Apple ecosystem with my iPad, MacBook, AirPods and an old iPod and Iâ€™m not disappointed here too. To those of you who are wondering how is it different from iPhone 8 since it practically ...
 if we hit again the same search item .. it is giving the last record as shown in the above ... return render_template(&apos;results.html&apos;, reviews=reviews) changed as return render_template(&apos;results.html&apos;, reviews=reviews[0:(len(reviews) - 1)])

 to avoid last row in the else section of the code.. it means first time searching... if reviews.count() &gt; 0:  # if there is a collection with searched keyword and it has records in it
    return render_template(&apos;results.html&apos;, reviews=reviews)  # show the results to use
I think we have to change this code to not show the last row ...  what changes we have to do ... did you got my question??"

In the graph below we have printed a confusion matrix and a self-explanatory classification report.

The confusion matrix shows that, 42(43) mediums were wrongly predicted as high, 2 mediums were wrongly predicted as low and 52(51) mediums were accurately predicted as mediums. Confusion matrix 

In the graph below we have printed a confusion matrix and a self-explanatory classification report.

The confusion matrix shows that, 42(43) mediums were wrongly predicted as high, 2 mediums were wrongly predicted as low and 52(51) mediums were accurately predicted as mediums. for me little changes are coming in Confusion Matrix.. Instead of using random forest classification.. which other models can give better performance in this case? can you help to explore further ??

1. Like local gateway links the data source from the local machine. How a gateway is established with the real time data on the internet.

2. How to set the refresh rate to say 5 mins rather than to a fixed time of a day 

3. Is it possible to display this real time dashboard report on the server to displayed on your own website 

4. How dynamic RSL works and advantages as we still have to specify the roles as we did in the static. Then what is the difference?

5. Use of a parameter since same work can be done with the help of a slicer that is to view data with respect to the members of a column. It can be done easily with a slicer too

ticket_gen,"Hi Team,
You are doing a great job. Thanks for that.

I am a telecom engineer &amp; have 9 years of experience. I have worked on different telecom application support.
I have worked on Linux OS &amp; have understanding about it and also have worked on writing sql queries as well.

Now i want to transition into data science or a new domain. I have myself studied python &amp; Java  to an extent and also interested in coding as well.

Which line i should pick now to transition like data science ,ML,DL etc so that i can transition from my current role.
As i have 9 years of exp so i would like to transition ASAP so that i can pick something otherwise as per experience might be things not work like i want.

What is the role of data science engineer.is it like core developer or anything else?

Currently i am doing free python course which you guys are providing.
Which other course i can join either paid or free to pick up the pace.
I know i have understanding about different technical things &amp; coding logic but problem is i get confused and can&apos;t collect things at one place to use it.
Definitely i need a mentor.

Last but not the least is there any website or source where i can get the practice material."

b) If the value of feature #2 is equal to 10 for all samples in the dataset, then feature #2 can be discarded.

ticket_gen,"Thank you Mr. Jiwitesh, Okay let me elaborate, currently if we write some research paper, we get some reviews on how it could be improved. They tell us if there is any flaw in the write up, if the abstract is not relavant, if the introduction is too long, if something is plagarised, if any additional details could be given and all sort of things like that. This involves manual effort and i would like to automate this. So the end goal of the work is to build a model which could give all these reviews as a human does, hence replacing manual work. What i think is basic q&amp;a to do this, but it may be restricted in scope. Please let me know on your thoughts on approaching this. "

There are two ways i created the environment

WAY 1 :--&gt;
Create Environment --&gt; PY36_TF19_KERAS22_TORCH14
conda activate PY36_TF19_KERAS22_TORCH14
conda install -c anaconda ipykernel
python -m ipykernel install --user --name=PY36_TF19_KERAS22_TORCH14

WAY 2 :--&gt;
Here i simply created the TFOD114 using following command
conda create -n TFOD114 python=3.6
conda activate TFOD114

Basically after using above 2 the only difference i can see is in jupyter kernel apart from &quot;python 3.6&quot; i can also see &quot;PY36_TF19_KERAS22_TORCH14&quot;
Do you have any idea what does this extra command actually doing (mentioned below) and what is benefit and consequences of doing it.

ticket_gen,P-value = 2(1 â€“ F(2.32)) = .0204
ticket_gen,"In the below question, if the sample size was 69 or 100 instead of 16 as given and as we are assuming that the data is normally distributed. We should have used Z-stats instead of T- stats right??"
ticket_gen,In the above question u took alternate hypothesis of H1: Population mean is not equal to 18000 km and performed 2 tail test. But if i take Ho: Mean =18000 and H1: Mean &lt; 18000.  Our T(test) = 1.33 and t(0.01) = 2.607. Here also t(test)&lt;t(0.01) and hence we reject null hypothesis. Am i correct??? Is this also one of the right approach??
ticket_gen,"hi in the example in class, to calculate t(test) you said its population mean of x - population mean of y. But u used the variances (26.94-24.50) instead of the means (210.40-208.92)... Am i wrong?"
ticket_gen,He has an exceptional way of teaching.. Better than college professors..
ticket_gen,"Hi in today&apos;s class sudhanshu said that we find a new value of m (from mx+b) and insert it to the logit function (p/1-p) to find a straight line equation. We keep on doing this till out cost function has the lowest value (i hope i am correct till here).. What i am confused is that, we were told we use sigmoid function to find the probability and if its &gt;0.5 then 1 or else 0. Then why do we use new value of m in logit function.. We can&apos;t we use new value of m in sigmoid function??? Pls call me if required.. its too difficult explaining over skype messaging."

Hope you had a good weekend!
 
This morning I spoke with a client who are going to be looking for a number of Python Developers who have good Django experience, and this would be a fully remote, 6 Month contract. 
 
The contract would however be Inside IR35, and are ideally looking at a daily rate of Â£500 per day. 
 
I know some people are open to Inside roles and some arenâ€™t, so thought it would be worth reaching out to ask if this is something you would consider?
 
The client is also a governmental company, so would ideally need to be eligible for SC Clearance. 
 
If this isnâ€™t quite right, but you are looking for something new, again please let me know what would stand out for you.
 
Kind regards,"

ticket_gen,did you get my question ?
ticket_gen,I am enrolled in dlcvnlp course I have some doubts regarding my project can u please guide me with that?
ticket_gen,"sir I have made a time series forecasting api by using ARIMA but when I want to save the model using .pkl extension the pickle which is generated is of 100 mb So, this is the first drawback of the model and second is it only given prediction till the last date in the test set , so , I need to retrain the model several times to get accurate results."
ticket_gen,sir first of all I want to reduce the size of the pickle file and secondly I want to remove the dependency of test set on final prediction
ticket_gen,actually the class is just started and It is my personal project so i want some guidance on it
ticket_gen,atleast I can get guidance on that ?? sir i just need guidance on my project I had build a time series model using ARIMA and when I am going to make .pkl of it the file created is of 100 mb so I am unable to deploy it on heroku due to large size of file and second in when i use arima model it gives the prediction only till the last date of training set so i have to retrain my model after a fixed duration of time so I need guidance on how can i tackle this problem is sir
ticket_gen,sir in arima model we take test set which contains only nan values then we give prediction on that test set so on deployment time it only gives prediction till last date of test set I think it is done in that way Please correct me if i am doing wrong
ticket_gen,"yes sir one column is date and another column is the feature that i want to predict and in that column Nan values is stored sir, I have to forecast the data  so i created that nan values in the dataset"
ticket_gen,"I get this error I am missing something..Not sure what it is... Would be very helpful if i get a working session with you....Pls help
 "
ticket_gen,Tensorflow failed... I tried all the methods and nothing worked out PLs help
ticket_gen,I get this error Could you please help I followed whatever he said... Could you please help me with this error only? pls

ticket_gen,Restarted the system Still get the same error
ticket_gen,any specific version should i try?
ticket_gen,i want to do it like line 44 below that line it will give me total sum not my desired output i want output like line 44 but using list comprehension
ticket_gen,can&apos;t we append more than one using list comprehension without enclosing them but i am getting error i am able to add them when i enclose them but if i don&apos;t enclose them it shows me erroe error
ticket_gen,"c = [i,i+1 for i in range (2,5)]"
ticket_gen,"can this work like:
i = [ ]
for x in range(2,5):
  i.append(x)

ticket_gen,no i was just asking that it may work or not
ticket_gen,"my husband is planning for his higher studies in UK in Artificial Intelligence, he got offer letter of study from 2 universities"

ticket_gen,"Hello sir...this code is not working in my notebook, the error its showing I didn&apos;t understand"
ticket_gen,I didn&apos;t find any accurate solution
ticket_gen,"Hi....I have a question:
There are 2 functions percentile and quantile....
For quantile, should we sort data first or not required?
I tested myself, and felt sorting of data is not required for quantile function....but I read somewhere that we should sort data first"
ticket_gen,"Please clear my doubt:
1) Should data be sorted in these?
2) Difference b/w Percentile and Quantile?"
ticket_gen,Hi...I saw the video but my questions are still not covered in the video I want to know difference b/w Quantile and Percentile &quot;function&quot;...
ticket_gen,Do I need to sort data while passing my data to these functions? Or function itself will take care?
ticket_gen,"My name --&gt; Ruby Upadhyay Sir, I want to know about function and not definition Can I show my screen? I am clear with the definitions but I have doubt about df.quantile(0.25) and np,percentile(df, 0.25) functions.... Its not a screenshot I am practicing something...so want to show u in Jupyter Notebook Sir, I don&apos;t know how to make video? For everything, are we reqd to make video? It will take lot of time I will have to explain.... We were never told that for everything we have to make videos"
ticket_gen,"My question is simple....Why I am getting different values for df.quantile(0.25) and np,percentile(df, 0.25) functions"
ticket_gen,"Now in this, what video should I make? Pls guide how to share in html format. Being a beginner, I am not sure how to share that"
ticket_gen,Doubt: Problem in Percentile....why 25% of percentile is 3.0345.Doubt: Problem in Percentile....why 25% of percentile is 3.0345.
ticket_gen,"Regarding 2nd part of the question, we need not to explicitly sort the data while using quantile and percentile function? Correct?"
ticket_gen,Can u pls guide what I am doing wrong here?
ticket_gen,"Sir, this one is not present. Could u pls tell which link?"
ticket_gen,"But now there are 2 Country columns So how it can be achieved in a single step <ss type=""laugh"">:D</ss> I mean is it possible in one step?"

ticket_gen,is ML session which is happening at 9 today ?
ticket_gen,one more thing all question should be solve by using libraries or manually. the reason behind of asking this is that we are not taught stats library yet? in the stats class
ticket_gen,I can join If i miss any class how can i refer that again Is there a portal or something? Wat course materials do you give? Ok Hi i would like to join the batch frm tmrw I have just made the payment Can you confirm?

ticket_gen,Sir i was trainig Alexnet using my custom dataset of 5 classe. I generated images using ImageGernerator() and using fit_generator() I trianed it. And my loss instead decreasing it was increasing after every epoch. I don&#39;t know what I missed or did wrong.
ticket_gen,Sir the issue is resolved now. I think i was using the ImageGernerator () it was bcz of that. In that case even i was not using the validation for model evaluation. Because i don&#39;t know that how to create feature and labels of image of custom dataset. But i figured it out.
ticket_gen,Even i used google collab for the first time it is quite fast but disconnecting again n again bcz of this 2G internet.
ticket_gen,And sir is it possible to use dataset from the local harddisk to google collab. I am trying to uplaod my dataset but It is showing that it would take 27hrs
ticket_gen,"Sir i was trying to train my model on google colab. The no of images are 26k each of 227*227 shape. The problem that i am facing is that whenever i am tring to reshape thos high resolution image to 227*227 it is taking a huge amount of time evem more than my laptop. On setting GPU it is much more time than the cpu. Second problem that i am facing is  when i am trying to normalise the data using X/255.0 it disconnects from the session and reconnects again. I know it is because of memory issue bcz my data is huge So is there any way to get rid of these problems? But it is crashing again n again.. not executing If time would have been Sir cloud services means. DLCVNLP Sir Should i wait for the next classes ? Sir i mean ki next classes ka wait kar leta hu, kyunki Sudanshu sir next classes me cover kar hi denge.."

ticket_gen,"Dear ineuron Team,

In the provided assignment there is problem-3 where we need to reverse the string input provided by user.

I have prepared code and not able to understand why this is giving wrong result.

#Solution
FirstName = str(input(&quot;Enter Your First Name :&quot;))
LastName = str(input(&quot;Enter Your Last Name :&quot;))
Name = FirstName + &apos; &apos; + LastName
i = len(Name)
while i &gt;= 0 :
print(Name[i-1],end = &apos;&apos;)
i = i - 1

As an output, it adds an extra character i.e. Name[-1] at the end of the output. I don&apos;t understand the logic behind it. As per the logic, while loop should terminate at i = 0 but it is terminating at i = -1."
ticket_gen,I did that but why I &gt;= 0 is giving wrong output?

ticket_gen,"I want to predict those 17 classes , how I can predict those"
ticket_gen,"Actually for multiclass classification what will be the basic approach to predict those classes, if I get that idea than I think it will be easy"
ticket_gen,like for 2 class its 1 and 0
ticket_gen,as I have taken weights of standard vgg16 model (it has 1000 classes). It is giving the label of that flower as 985
ticket_gen,"but as I have only 17 classes of flower ( 0 to 17) and that flower on which I was doing prediction was taken from class 2, I was expecting the result from class 2"
ticket_gen,its no of classes should have to match with our local dataset classes
ticket_gen,because that standard weight of vgg-16 dataset have 1000 classes
ticket_gen,and in our local dataset we have only 17 classes
ticket_gen,"I found the reason , actually model was using that standard weight thats why it was showing 1000 class"
